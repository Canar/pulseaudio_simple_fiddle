# PulseAudio-Simple Fiddle

*by Benjamin Cook*\

Version 0.0.0

A very limited library to facilitate writing raw audio data to a PulseAudio device using the pulseaudio-simple API. Documentation is very limited but should be adequate.

Developed for use with [rumu](https://github.com/Canar/rumu) and [luup](https://github.com/Canar/luup).

API-compatible with [pulseaudio_simple_ffi](https://github.com/Canar/pulseaudio_simple_ffi), a gem I wrote previously that uses FFI instead of Fiddle.
